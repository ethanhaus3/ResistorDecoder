Given a four color band resistor, determine the expected tolerance on Ohms

For a given set of four colors we look up each color in sequence. For the example shown the first band (1st) is red which corresponds to the number "2". The second (2nd) band is Violet which is the number "7". The multiplier is Green which is "x105". Lastly, the tolerance is given as a Gold band which corresponds to "±5%". The expected value is 27x105 Ohms with a tolerance of ±5%. This is written as:

2.7MΩ, ±5%
